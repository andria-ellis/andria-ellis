- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @andria-ellis
- ðŸŽ“ I'm trained in single-cell genomics 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in statistics and data analysis
- ðŸ’» I'm coding in R, Python and SQL 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about openAI embedding of text files

Projects detailed below are nuc-Connect-seq, the code for my thesis work, which was all completed in R and details the single-cell sequencing pipeline used to process data as well as all of the code for all paper figures. This process takes the raw sequencing, aligns it and cleans/normalises it, before clustering the single cells and labeling with marker genes to determine cell-types. 

Course Universe is a project I worked on for FutureLearn in 2023. Completely written in Python, it details the pulling of course description from the database, embedding it with OpenAI API functions, and then the entire pipeline of taking those embeddings to clusters, and all downstream statistical analysis performed for tools like, course recommendation, gap analysis and more
